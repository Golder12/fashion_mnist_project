# Fashion_mnist_project

This is a project for training a machine learning model that will be able to detect chest opacities using ultrasound images.

The two files, <i>ImgClass1.py</i>  and <i>hello2.py</i> are model creation trials. The models they contain both use the <u>Fashion_Mnist</u> dataset for both training and testing.

They both use similar libraries i.e tensorflow for the numerical computation using dataflow graphs, matplotlib which is a plotting library and keras among others.

The images are divided into 10 classifications and after the model once passed a test images, outputs 10 numbers, each being a probability of that input image being one of the 10 classifications.
